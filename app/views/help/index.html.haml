        You can type different markers when adding your tasks in order to
        set priority, repeats, and so on. Feel free to mix and match!
        Here's a full list:
      %table
        %thead
          %tr
            %th marker
            %th examples
            %th description
        %tbody
          %tr
            %td.dialog__cell.dialog__marker
              \!
              %strong> or
              '
            %td.dialog__cell !1 !2 '3
            %td.dialog__cell
              Set the priority of the task. Priority 1 tasks will appear
              before Priority 2 tasks in your queue, and a task with any
              priority will come before a task with no priority.  '1 is
              handy since !1 can be a pain to type on mobile.
          %tr
            %td.dialog__cell.dialog__marker #
            %td.dialog__cell #at-home #errand #standing-in-line
            %td.dialog__cell
              Adds a tag to the task. When tasks have been tagged, you will
              see buttons on the page which will allow you to select
              between different tags depending on where you're at.
          %tr
            %td.dialog__cell.dialog__marker @
            %td.dialog__cell @10:30am @10/05/2015 @10/05/2015-10:30am
            %td.dialog__cell
              Sets the date and/or time when a task will be released into
              your queue. So if you set the date for tomorrow at 10:30am,
              you will not see it in your queue until then.
          %tr
            %td.dialog__cell.dialog__marker *
            %td.dialog__cell *1d *3h *5m *1y
            %td.dialog__cell
              Repeat the task every day, 3 hours, 5 minutes, or 1 year. A
              full list of repeat abbreviations are:
              %strong s
              \-- seconds,
              %strong m
              or
              %strong mi
              \-- minutes,
              %strong h
              \-- hours,
              %strong d
              \-- days,
              %strong mo
              \-- months, and
              %strong y
              \-- years. As of yet we don't have a way to repeat at a
              particular time of day or day of the week/month. The repeat will
              start counting from the moment you mark it as done. So if you say
              *3d, it will reappear in your queue 3 days after you mark it as
              finished.
          %tr
            %td.dialog__cell.dialog__marker ~
            %td.dialog__cell ~1d ~3h ~5m
            %td.dialog__cell
              Sets a time estimate on the task. This impacts how much you
              are allowed to place in timeframes and can be used with smart
              tags to find tasks above or below a certain estimate. It uses
              the same abbreviations as repeats.
